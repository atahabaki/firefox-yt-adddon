# YouTube Search Engine

Adds YouTube search engine to your firefox browser. In URL bar you could just 
type "@youtube search_query".

I'm developing also another great extension which is a multi search engine,
currently in development. Take a look at it 
[here](https://github.com/atahabaki/smart-search). I recommend it.

If you want follow what I'm currently working and developing... Follow my
GitHub account. Stay tuned!..

## How this works?

Firefox has a `chrome_settings_overrides.search_provider` to add your search 
engine to the omnibox. Please, take a look at 
[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/chrome_settings_overrides).
